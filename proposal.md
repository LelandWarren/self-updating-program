# Engineering Proposal: Self-Updating Application Prototype

## Overview

This document outlines the development of a self-updating application prototype, including key decisions, assumptions made during the implementation, and potential next steps to enhance scalability and production readiness.

## Project Summary

The self-updating application prototype consists of two primary components:

1. **Backend API**: Built with NestJS, the backend manages software versions and provides an endpoint for clients to query the latest available version based on the operating system.
   
2. **Client Script**: A simple Node.js script that queries the backend for the latest version and simulates the download of an update based on the operating system.

## Implementation Details

### Backend

- **Framework**: NestJS was chosen for its modularity, ease of use, and strong support for TypeORM, which simplifies database interactions.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL was selected as the database, with Docker used for containerization and easy setup across different environments.
- **Version Management**: The backend includes two main entities:
  - `Version`: Represents a software version with fields like `version`, `release_notes`, and `release_date`.
  - `VersionFile`: Represents a file associated with a specific version and operating system.

- **Key Endpoint**: 
  - **GET /version/latest?os={os}**: Returns the latest version available for the specified operating system. If no files match the specified OS, it returns the latest version regardless of the OS, but without associated files.

### Client

- **Simple Node.js Script**: The client script queries the backend for the latest version and simulates the process of downloading an update.
- **Environment Configuration**: The client can be configured via a `.env` file or command-line arguments, allowing flexibility in specifying the backend URL and target operating system.

## Assumptions

1. **Version-OS Association**: It is assumed that not all versions will have files for every operating system. The backend is designed to return the latest version that matches the requested OS, or the latest version without any OS-specific files if no match is found.
   
2. **Initial Data Population**: The backend relies on an `init.sql` script for initial database setup and population. It assumes that the database is empty when the script is first run.

3. **Simplified Client Interaction**: The client script is designed for simplicity and assumes that the user or automation will handle the decision-making process (e.g., whether to download an update).

4. **Single User**: The prototype is built with the assumption that it will be used by a single client at a time, which simplifies the design and implementation.

## Potential Next Steps

### 1. **Scalability Enhancements**

- **Database Optimization**: Consider optimizing database queries and indexing strategies to handle large datasets efficiently, especially as the number of versions and associated files grows.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use a CDN to cache and deliver static assets (e.g., installation files) closer to users, reducing the load on the backend and improving download speeds.

### 2. **Production-Ready Features**

- **Security Best Practices**: Secure the application by enforcing HTTPS, setting up proper CORS policies, and regularly updating dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities. Additionally, consider implementing security headers, SQL injection prevention mechanisms, and data encryption at rest and in transit.
- **Advanced Client Features**: Enhance the client script to support automated downloads, background updates, and more sophisticated error handling and rollback mechanisms.

### 3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

- **Automated Testing**: Integrate automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- **Deployment Automation**: Set up automated deployment processes to streamline updates and reduce the risk of human error during releases.

### 5. **User Experience and Client Interaction**

- **GUI Client**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for the client to make it more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users.
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Expand the client to support multiple operating systems natively, potentially packaging it as a standalone application using tools like Electron.

## Conclusion

This prototype serves as a solid foundation for a self-updating application, demonstrating key concepts and providing a base for further development. By addressing the potential next steps outlined above, the system can be made more scalable, secure, and user-friendly, making it suitable for production deployment in a variety of environments.
